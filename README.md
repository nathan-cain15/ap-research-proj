Ap research is a course where each student choices a topic and spends the entire year researching said topic, identifying a gap, and performing research to address the gap.

Open ended evolution(OEE) is a term coined to generally describe how evolutionary proccesses like biological evolution seem to never end, constantly displaying increases in complexity, novelty, and diversity.

This study came from early computer simulation experiments which were working with evolution and ecological dynmaics. A common occurance was that even if the author's were intentionally trying to make the simulation continously evolve, each simulation would reach a state of stasis where nothing discerably novel would evolve.

Research into OEE has produced theories and frameworks to hypothosize how an open-ended simulation can be built. Althrough not the only area of OEE research, it is promising as it brings progress to building an OEE simulation, however other areas are important like coming up with better definitions and tools to identify OEE.

For my research, I mainly built off of the works of Tim Taylor and Wolfgang Banzhaf, who layed the groundworks for how an OEE system can be built. They discuss mainy avenues that can be taken to build such a system, and what elements it would contain. The element I looked at was building a simulation in a physical environment with evolving entities that would directly interact with their environment to evolve. A critism of past simulations were that they are simply not complex enough, and so therefore can not produce complex results.
